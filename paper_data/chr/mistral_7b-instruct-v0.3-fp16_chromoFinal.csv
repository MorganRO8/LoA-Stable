cyclobutadiene dimer,not provided,838.28,776.14,0.5,not provided,"The study demonstrates the role of double-triplet [1(T1T1)] configuration and charge transfer configurations in the closely π-stacked dimers of 4nπ-electron systems, such as cyclobutadiene dimers. The results suggest that the diatropicity on each monomer in the closely π-stacked 4nπ-dimers originates from the diatropicity of each T1-like monomer in the TT configuration in the double-triplet state. The energy stabilization of the dimer at small d can be obtained by the intermolecular bonding-like interactions between the remaining 2 + 2 valence electrons that are formally unpaired within each monomer but coupled each other over the dimer.",chemrxiv_10.26434_SLASH_chemrxiv-2024-rrpw2-v2,,,0.0736675751

The hydrogel with 10% content of NIPAM presented ~1–5% volume shrinkage, while there was around 8–10% volume shrinkage regarding those with a content of NIPAM over 20%. Consequently, the hydrophilic–hydrophobic balance of the isopropylamide groups in NIPAM units changed with the increase in the ambient temperature. At lower temperatures, the hydrogel network absorbed water due to hydrogen bond interactions with water molecules. With the increase in ambient temperature, the hydrogen bond associations were weakened or destroyed, while the hydrophobic interactions between hydrophobic groups (-CH(CH3)28) increased, causing volume shrinkage and fluorescence color changes from yellow to pink.",pubmed_11175109,,,0.2184056044

Additionally, a CHX chase experiment with lysosome inhibitors Pepstatin A and E64-d increased the stability of the p.Ser420Phe CRY2 variant, providing evidence that the CC-helix of CRY2 is pivotal not only for its interaction with E3 ligases but also for its degradation through the lysosomal pathway.",pubmed_10731238,,,0.5070109791

NiOx-YSZ,CO2,null,null,null,null,"Electrochemical reduction of CO2 on Ni-YSZ electrodes at high temperature requires the presence of H2 in the CO2 inlet stream. It is believed that in pure CO2 streams the reaction fails due to oxidation of the Ni-YSZ electrode. Using operando Raman spectroscopy and online mass spectroscopy, we have shown that CO2 can in fact be reduced on the Ni-YSZ surface. Our measurements, reveal that Ni-YSZ oxidizes to NiOx-YSZ within a pure CO2 stream. CO2 electrolysis is possible on this oxide surface via a surface oxygen and vacancy-mediated mechanism similar to those observed within other oxide cathodes such as CeOx. The deactivation of the electrode coincides with strongly reducing conditions and at current densities > 400 mA/cm2, NiOx is completely reduced coinciding with complete stoppage of CO production.",chemrxiv_10.26434_SLASH_chemrxiv-2022-1nntq,,,0.8131720554

The resulting isolated atoms are characterized using scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermal desorption of carbon monoxide. This method can yield relatively high loadings of single atoms (e.g., Pt, Ru, Ir), up to at least 1 atom nm-2 on a variety of supports.",chemrxiv_10.26434_SLASH_chemrxiv-2022-w298m-v2,,,0.1726021238

The study identifies a distinct and highly reversible Fe2+/Fe3+ redox event occurring within the MOF interior due to the nanoconfined (4.54 Å) pores gating the entry of charge-compensating anions. The study also reports a giant redox entropy change (i.e., 164 J K-1 mol-1) accompanying the BF4-intercalation redox chemistry within the Fe(TA)2 pores.",chemrxiv_10.26434_SLASH_chemrxiv-2022-0rvh2,,,0.3955217556

The exact structure of this chromophore was difficult to determine due to the presence of four peaks in the 13C NMR spectrum at –130 °C for the twelve ring C atoms, which could point to either a completely delocalized 12 π-electron system or a low energy barrier between two valence isomers. However, agreement between computed proton chemical shifts and experimental data based on minima structures optimized at M06-2X, ωB97X-D, and M11 levels confirm a bond localized C2h symmetry—consistent with its antiaromaticity.",chemrxiv_10.26434_SLASH_chemrxiv-2023-1mnz4,,,0.7492051187
